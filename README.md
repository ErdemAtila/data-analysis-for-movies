The COVID-19 pandemic significantly disrupted the global
film industry, prompting this comprehensive analysis of its impact using
data from The Movie Database (TMDB) between 2016 and 2023. This study
examines key metrics including movie release patterns, genre popularity
shifts, audience ratings, and content trends across pre-pandemic,
pandemic, and post-pandemic periods. Findings reveal a dramatic 14%
decrease in movie releases during 2020, followed by a strong recovery with
record highs of 20,480 releases in 2022. The research identifies notable
shifts in release scheduling, with post-pandemic periods showing
increased activity in September and October while traditional spring
releases declined. Genre analysis indicates resilience in drama and
comedy, while horror saw unexpected growth from 1,143 to 1,295 releases
post-pandemic. The study also observes changes in language distribution,
with English-language productions decreasing slightly while Spanish and
Korean content increased. Additionally, audience ratings remained
relatively stable across genres throughout the period, suggesting
consistent quality despite industry disruptions. These findings provide
valuable insights into the film industry's adaptability and evolution in
response to global crises.
